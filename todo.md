#TODOS

##test/test.js
- Add tests!

##src/todo.js
- Write full docs for this file
- Strip gitignore folders so node_modules/**/* works. Tranform node_modules/**/* to just node_modules
- Throw an error message when no .gitignore is present
- Put regexs at the top into a variable for when they become complex
- this is a todo

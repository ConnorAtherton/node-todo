This is a small module for collecting all the todos scattered
throughout a project and placing them in one easy to read file.

##Install
```npm install -g gen-todos```

##What is this?
When I finish working for the day I write down what needs to be done
in the project for the next day so I don't forget. This inevitably leads
to me wasting time the next day figuring out where to start instead of actually
starting.

Todos creates a single ```todo.md``` file at the root of a project to enable
individuals or teams to quickly start where they left off. This repo has its
own generated todos file. Go ahead and take a look at the format.

This is not designed to be a replacement for github issues in any way. Just an
easy way to remember little tasks that need to be done.

**This is still a work in progress**
